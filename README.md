# Analog-Quadcopter-Project

Howdy! I'm Carlos Alvarado, a sophomore electrical engineering student at the college of engineering of Texas A&M University.
If you are reading this, it is very likely that you are a recruiter who has taken a peek at my resume, and I thank you for your interest.
This project was my first practical experience directly related to electronics and I have learned much from it, so this repository will cover the specifics of what I have done.
First off, the purpose of this project came as a result of me wanting to record footage of my travels, however, I did not want to purchase a drone off the market because...that's quite simply boring isn't it?
So I did a lot of research, and I continued doing research because I was nervous on spending a large budget on a project that could possibly fail. However, by reading this, it means I did it anyway.
There are 5 integral parts of a quadcopter in order for it to function: The flight controller (FC), electronic speed controller (ESC), motors, battery, and the receiver module.
However, I have introduced a few new components in order for it to work to my liking, and those are the analog camera, paired with an analog visual transmitter, and a GPS module.

In reality, these are dangerous devices, as the components are small and the soldering pads are even smaller. This makes connections prone to bridging and therefore shorts. The battery voltage sits at 4.3 V and the motors connected pull 9.5 amps, which is quite powerful for such a small device. I selected brushless motors due to their much needed increase in control as compared to brushed motors. They are a very interesting subject on their own, as much of the magic behind these motors are in the tuning. There are many things to consider when a quadcopter is airborne; The parts including the motors become very hot as they draw very high amounts of power, slight distributions in power ratios between the motors can cause noise, which reduce control of the aircraft and amplifies when moving, and so therefore, there needs to be proper configurations in the quadcopter's computer to avoid such issues.

In my short span of engineering experience, I have already witnessed...explosive results. With such a high concentration of energy, errors can be detrimental. This also applies to the workplace. However, improvement does not happen if you do not fail miserably, and that is exactly what I have done. In the project's first test flight to collect much needed diagnostic and tuning data, There was a collision between the antenna and propeller, which resulted in a loss of control and a crash. The impact caused the front right motor to begin smoking profusely, and I instantly cut the power. This simple mistake cost me a large headache, as when I was removing the motor and resoldering a replacement motor, I was not cautious enough in my work, which caused an unintentional bridging with the flight controller (main computer) and fried both of them to a crisp. I was lucky it did not catch fire.

On a side note, while I was working on this project, I came across another issue before testing. My radio transmitter was outputting incorrect values and so I had to take it apart to figure out what was happening. It just so happened that the manufacturer did not exactly know what they were doing, and a wire came loose. So quite simply, resoldering the wire back into its place fixed the problem, or so I thought. The disconnection completely messed with the calibration of the controller, so I had to connect it to my computer and reprogram their values to work properly. At the very least, this mishap taught me much about transmitter and how they send signals, as well as what values they generate from their sensors.

This should be enough personal nonsense for readers. Please feel free to ask me about any other details if you are interested. I appreciate your time, and I sincerely hope you may consider offering me a much needed learning experience.
