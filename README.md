# Analog-Quadcopter-Project

Howdy! I'm Carlos Alvarado, a sophomore electrical engineering student at the college of engineering of Texas A&M University.
If you are reading this, it is very likely that you are a recruiter who has taken a peek at my resume, and I thank you for your interest.
This project was my first practical experience directly related to electronics and I have learned much from it, so this repository will cover the specifics of what I have done.
